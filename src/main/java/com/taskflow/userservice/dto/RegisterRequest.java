/*
 * Lombok annotations used on this class:
 * - @Getter / @Setter: generate getters and setters at compile time.
 * - @NoArgsConstructor / @AllArgsConstructor: generate a no-arg constructor and an all-args constructor.
 * - @Builder: generate a fluent builder API (provides a static builder() method).
 *
 * Purpose: Reduce boilerplate â€” repetitive code such as getters, setters,
 * constructors, equals/hashCode, and toString that do not contain business logic.
 *
 * Description: This DTO represents a user registration request carrying the
 * user's email and password. It is used to transfer registration data from
 * the client to the server (for example, during a sign-up endpoint).
 *
 * Security note: Do not log the `password` field or expose it in responses.
 * Handle and store credentials securely (e.g., hash passwords before saving).
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Add Lombok dependency to your `pom.xml` (groupId: org.projectlombok, artifactId: lombok).
 * - Enable "Annotation Processing" in IntelliJ so the IDE/compiler recognize generated code.
 *
 * Note: Lombok generates code at compile time; the generated methods are not visible
 * in source files but are available to the compiler and runtime when annotation
 * processing is enabled.
